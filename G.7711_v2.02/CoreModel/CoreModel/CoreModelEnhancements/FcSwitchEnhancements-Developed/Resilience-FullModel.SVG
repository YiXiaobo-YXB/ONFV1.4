If the scheme is revertive then when a resource of higher priority than the currently selected resource recovers it will be selected.&#13;
This is equivalent to working/protection but allows for all static scheme types with n:m capability. &#13;
In simple schemes 0 = working and 1 = protecting.&#13;
If selection priority of a Route is increased in value and the Route is currently selecting this Route, then if another Route of a lower selection priority value is available the wait to restore process will come into action as if the other Route had just become available.&#13;
If selection priority of a Route is changed and the FC is not currently selecting this Route but is selecting an item that is now of a higher numeric value than the changed Route, then the wait to restore process will come into action as if the other Route had just become available.</title>
