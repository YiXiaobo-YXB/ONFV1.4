<title>The ForwardingDomain (FD) class models the topological component that represents a forwarding capability that provides the opportunity to enable forwarding (of specific transport characteristic information at one or more protocol layers) between points.&#13;
The FD object provides the context for and constrains the formation, adjustment and removal of FCs and hence offers the potential to enable forwarding.&#13;
The FCs may be formed between LTPs at the boundary of the FD or between physical ports at the boundary of the FD (for media layers).&#13;
A number of FDs (related by Links) may be grouped and abstracted to form an FD where that FD represents the effect of the underlying FDs but where the detailed structure is not apparent.&#13;
This grouping and abstraction is potentially recursive.&#13;
An FD represents an abstraction of some combination of software behavior, electronic behavior and physical structure that provides a forwarding capability. &#13;
At a lower level of recursion an FD could represent a forwarding capability within a device. &#13;
A device may encompass two or more disjoint forwarding capabilities and may support more than one layer protocol, hence more than one FD.&#13;
A routing fabric may be logically partitioned to represent connectivity constraints, hence the FD representing the routing fabric may be partitioned into a number of FDs representing the constraints.&#13;
The FD represents a subnetwork [ITU-T G.800], FlowDomain [TMF 612] and a MultiLayerSubNetwork (MLSN) [TMF 612]. &#13;
