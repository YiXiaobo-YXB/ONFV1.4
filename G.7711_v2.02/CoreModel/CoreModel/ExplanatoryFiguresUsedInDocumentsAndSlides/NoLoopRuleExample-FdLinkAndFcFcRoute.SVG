For digital layer networks, in its basic form (i.e., point-to-point Link) it associates a set of LTP clients on one FD with an equivalent set of LTP clients on another FD. &#13;
Like the FC, the Link has ports (LinkPort) which take roles relevant to the constraints on flows offered by the Link (e.g., Root role or leaf role for a Link that has a constrained Tree configuration).</title>
