It will indicate switch state and change of state.&#13;
The switch can be switched away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all sources (is "open").&#13;
The ability for a Switch to be "high impedance" allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.&#13;
This ability allows multiple alternate routes to be present that otherwise would be in conflict.</title>
